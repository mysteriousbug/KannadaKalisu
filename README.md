**Project Title:** KannadaKalisu: Intelligent Pronunciation Correction for Kannada Language Learning

**Project Description:**

KannadaKalisu is an open-source project aimed at improving language learning outcomes for students in government schools by providing intelligent pronunciation correction support for the Kannada language. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and audio signal processing to enable real-time feedback on pronunciation accuracy.

**Key Features:**

- **Audio Processing:** Utilizes the librosa library for audio signal processing, extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features from spoken words in Kannada.

- **Machine Learning:** Leverages TensorFlow/Keras for building and training deep learning models capable of recognizing correct and incorrect pronunciations based on extracted MFCC features.

- **Web Application:** Implements a user-friendly web interface using Flask/Django, allowing students to input spoken words and receive instant feedback on pronunciation accuracy.

- **Real-time Feedback:** Employs real-time audio processing techniques to provide immediate feedback to users, enabling them to improve their pronunciation skills interactively.

**How to Contribute:**
